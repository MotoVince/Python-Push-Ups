Hello all and welcome.
You have stumbled onto my first breaths of my Python coding journey.

While the prime focus of my studies as a part time student of I.T. is network engineering and cloud computing, 
I hope to sharpen my scripting skills with Python in order to automate, develop and eventually consider myself fluid in the language. 

In this git repository my main focus is to convert my ITP100 Software design homework assignments, from pseudocode into to functioning Python3 code. 

Consider this getting my reps in. Practice makes better right?

My other focus is get to know GIT. 

At this point I'm pretty much still a complete noob when it come to using this powerful resources. 

But by the end of this I hope to be able to push and track versions of my code as well as showcasing my skills for possibly future employers. 
 
Thanks for stopping by, 
Vince.
